# Light Dark Toggle

This flutter project is based on the design made by Matthieu Souteyrand on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5846239-Light-dark-toggle-switch-InVision-Studio).He describes the design as: 
> Back to UI motion with Invision Studio! This shot is a simple idea I had in mind, mixing a segmented control / toggle hybrid with a light theme / dark theme motion into one visual.
